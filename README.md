# Blockchain based EHR using IPFS

An **Electronic Health Record (EHR)** is an electronic version of a patients medical history, that is maintained by the provider over time, and may include all of the key administrative clinical data relevant to that persons care under a particular provider.A centralised medical record helps to identify a personâ€™s health status from any site regardless of distance .When talking about cons, we should also confer the pros. Actually, centralisation is a curse to the
modern internet .It is as similar as giving all the power to a single authority,
and thus helping it to become a privileged fraud.So this system is trying to decentralizse the health record by using a trending decentralization technology called blockchain.

**Blockchain** helps to digitalise documents in decentralized manner. But blockchain alone as a storage is not a scalable option, so this EHR
uses an integrated distributed storage technology called **IPFS**.

Using IPFS and blockchain, transparency and integrity of the datas will be maintained and also
data redundancy and latency will be avoided. This system enables the user
to give healthcare professionals access to their personal health data and then
records interactions with this data in an auditable, transparent and secure way
on the distributed ledger.Users will be able to leverage their medical data to 
power a plethora of applications and services and thus it is going to revolu-
tionize the eHealth industry with greater efficiency by eliminating many of the intermediates as we know them today.
